# Steam Achievement Manager

The code is being made available so that those interested can do as they like with it.

There are some changes to the code since the last closed-source release:
- General code maintenance to bring it into a more modern state.
- Icons have been replaced with ones from the Fugue Icons set.

[Download latest release](https://github.com/muteburrito/SAM/releases).

## Attribution

Most (if not all) icons are from the [Fugue Icons](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/) set.
